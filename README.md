## **CONCLUSION**

</div>



This QA project was developed with the aim of improving my skills in software testing and learning new technologies. Throughout the development of this project, I used the **[Jira](https://angela-ribeiro.atlassian.net/jira/projects?selectedProjectType=software)** platform to create my bug reports. I look forward to further expanding my knowledge and contributing to future projects.
