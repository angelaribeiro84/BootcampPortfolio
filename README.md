## Overview
</div>

Welcome to my QA Bootcamp Project repository. This project is a comprehensive showcase of my journey through the Tripleten Brazil QA Bootcamp, where I explored various facets of software testing through hands-on experience with three different applications: Urban Routes, Urban Grocery, and Urban Scooter. Each phase of the project is designed to build on previous knowledge and introduce new technical skills.

&nbsp;

### Urban Routes
The first phase of the project focused on **foundational testing concepts**. I began by learning the **basics of QA analysis**, including **development and testing practices**, the creation of **checklists**, **bug reports**, and **test cases**. This foundational knowledge was crucial for understanding the principles of **test design** and **requirements analysis**. I delved into creating detailed **test documentation**, designing **flowcharts** and **mind maps**, and exploring techniques such as **equivalence classes** and **boundary value** analysis.

In addition, I gained hands-on experience with **web app testing**. This included understanding how web apps operate, the **fundamentals of HTTP**, and the distinctions between **backend** and **frontend** technologies. I conducted **UI testing** for web applications, and became familiar with **cross-platform** and **cross-browser testing**, as well as **responsive web design**. I also learned to use tools like **Figma** for layout design and **Jira** for managing bug reports.


&nbsp;

### Urban Grocery
The second phase concentrated on **API testing**. I explored **RESTful services** and **JSON** data formats, and used **Postman** for API testing. I also learned to design effective API tests and worked with documentation tools such as **ApiDoc** and **Swagger**. This phase was essential for understanding how to ensure the functionality and reliability of APIs.


&nbsp;


### Urban Scooter
In the third phase, I applied the theoretical knowledge gained to practical tasks. The tasks included testing the Urban Scooter web application and its associated API. This phase allowed me to consolidate my learning by applying it to real-world scenarios and complex testing challenges.


&nbsp;



### 5th Sprint
The final phase of the project introduced **database basics**. I learned to navigate the **command line**, grasp **fundamental SQL concepts**, and establish **remote server** connections. These skills were vital for understanding data management and enhancing the overall testing process.

## **CONCLUSION**

</div>



This QA project was developed with the aim of improving my skills in software testing and learning new technologies. Throughout the development of this project, I used the **[Jira](https://angela-ribeiro.atlassian.net/jira/projects?selectedProjectType=software)** platform to create my bug reports. I look forward to further expanding my knowledge and contributing to future projects.
